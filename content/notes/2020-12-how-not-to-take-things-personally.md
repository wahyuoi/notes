1. It is not about me. 

* Change perspective from "me" to "we". 
* Look at the other person intentions.

2. It is about me

* Give yourself empathy
* Speak up, being vulnerable & open up without blaming other can increase the other one understand you

3. People may attack, criticise, ignore you. Remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value
